### âœ… **1. What if I want to shut down the computer now and restart tomorrow?**

Make sure to recompile config-server before you dockerized the other applications.

When you shut down your system:

- The containers will stop.
- The data will remain **if configured correctly** (weâ€™ll handle MySQL data persistence below).
- Tomorrow, just do:

```bash
  docker-compose up -d
```

> The `-d` means **detached mode** â€” it will start everything in the background.

You **don't need to rebuild** (`--build`) unless you change the code or Dockerfile.

---

### âœ… **2. If I add another service like `product`, do I need to docker-compose again?**

Yes, youâ€™ll need to **re-run** `docker-compose up -d --build` from the same parent folder (`ECommerce`) after adding the new service to `docker-compose.yml`.

That ensures the new container is built and started.

---

### âœ… **3. From ECommerce parent directory I ran docker-compose â€” where do I run from again?**

Yes, you should always run from the **directory where `docker-compose.yml` lives**, which is your `ECommerce` parent folder.

To **restart the containers tomorrow**, just run:

```bash
  docker-compose up -d
```

(If you're not sure which containers are already running, `docker ps` will show you.)

### ðŸ§˜ Final reassurance: 

#### docker-compose up -d : to start existing built containers

#### docker-compose up -d --build : to rebuild after changing the docker-compose.yml

#### Every day before work:
##### - Just `docker-compose up -d` and youâ€™re back online.
##### - Swagger page will take some time to load, don't panic, try opening them again in a new tab.
##### - If swagger pages not loading after few attempts, do docker-compose up -d --build
