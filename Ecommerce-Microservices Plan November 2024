ECommerce-Microservices Plan : November 2024

Stories :

1. On Payment Confirmation(Status.PAYMENT_COMPLETED) :  An Entry to Order table should be generated
                                                        Without any explicit calls
                                                        Should have razorpay_order_id column and status should be Status.ORDER_GENERATED

2. On Order Generation, Admin will approve the order and change Status.ORDER_CONFIRMED or Status.ORDER_REJECTED(Delivery Not Possible)
   On Order.Status.ORDER_CONFIRMED : TXT Message & Email invoice to Customer
   Generate a new table customer_order as Customer : Order (@OneToMany)

2. On Order Confirmation, Seller can Accept or Reject the order.
   
   If Accepted : Order.Status.SELLER_ACCEPTED should be populated Order.pickup_date should be the next working day.

3. On Pick-up date Delivery will get assigned the order table to pick-up

4. Once Pick-up is done, Status.ORDER_PICKEDUP

5. Now order will be dispatched on next day

Will think about the next steps after step 5.
